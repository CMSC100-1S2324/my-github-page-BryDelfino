                    Hello! I am Bryan Kyle V. Delfino, but you can call me Bry.<br>
                    I am originally from Sta. Rosa but moved to Los Baños to pursue<br>
                    on my bachelor's degree on Computer Science. I was born on June<br>
                    26, 2003. In my childhood, I was not really exposed to programming.<br> 
                    I actually dream of becoming a mechanical engineer but then reality<br>
                    struck me and I thought to myself that maybe I am not for the <br>
                    engineering program. I love to play video games, watching TV shows,<br> 
                    make music and drawing. I love being carefree and just being myself.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class = "entry">
                    My first exposure in programming was in grade school. This was when<br> 
                    I was introduced to HTML and CSS. My first exposure of a real<br> 
                    programming language did not come until I was in Senior High School<br> 
                    where I took a programming elective which focuses on Java Programming<br> 
                    (without the OOP concepts). I got offered to study in University of the<br> 
                    Philippines Los Baños where the degree program offered was BS Computer<br> 
                    Science. Because of this, I got exposed to other programming languages<br> 
                    like Python and C. My knowledge on previously learned programming<br>
                    concepts are improved and I developed an interest in programming.<br> 
                    Currently, I am in my third year in the university and so far,<br> 
                    everything seems to be fine and I am still surviving. As of today, I am<br> 
                    currently taking three major subjects where each of them focuses on<br> 
                    Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Programming. I dream<br> 
                    of working in the cybersecurity industry and someday, I hope to achieve<br> 
                    that dream.
