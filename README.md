# How To Create A GitHub Page?
1. Clone your GitHub repository to be published via GitHub pages. Clone it to your local machine using:
```
git clone <link of GitHub Repository> 
```
use your Personal Access Token when cloning.

2. Add an HTML & CSS file to the local repository. You can either create a new branch, add those files, push, and merge them or add them directly to the main branch.
3. Modify these files.
4. After modifying, stage all the files made. You can stage all the files that re made with using:
```
git add --all
```
5. Commit the staged files using:
```
git commit -m "<add message here>"
```
6. You can either push it to main directly which will require no Pull Request for merging:
```
git push origin main
```
or if you made all your creations/ modifications in another branch, push the branch you created:
```
git push origin <name of branch>
```
This will require a Pull Request and if approved, can be merged to the main branch.
7. Now that the assets have been pushed or let us assume that the branch has been merged to main, we will deploy the site. In your repository's home page, go to the 'settings' tab (The one with the gear icon).
8. From the menu of the left side, under the 'code and automation' category, go to 'Pages'.
9. From there, you can deploy your site. A link will be provided and when the link is visited, your project will be shown.

# Key Takeaways from the exercise
The exercise refreshed me once again from the basics of HTML and CSS. This exercise made my understanding of classes and divs much better and because of this, I can easily comprehend the layout of what I want for my web page. It made me design a web page better (compared from my last website that I used as a project from the 'previous projects' section of my exercise). With CSS as well, the possibilities of designing the website are endless and satisfies my liking with a bit of researching and tinkering. Overall, this exercise was a fun!
